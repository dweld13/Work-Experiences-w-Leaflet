# Work-Experiences-w-Leaflet

Overview:
Created a map using Leaflet and the Leaflet sidebar plugin to document my previous work experiences. Sidebar contains an overview of work experiences and links to some projects and profiles. Clicking on the markers shows job title, company, and dates.

Continuing development:
Need to add sidebar button to display sidebar again after it was closed (especially for mobile).
